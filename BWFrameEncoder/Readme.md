# Black & White frame encoder

This is a PC program I made to encode the video frames for the Bad Apple tech demo.

It will process a whole folder of same-sized PNG images and encode them into a single output file. It is limited to monochrome black & white images, which is perfect for the Bad Apple animation which is all silhouettes.

For details on the encoding algorithm, read the readme.txt file in the Data folder.
